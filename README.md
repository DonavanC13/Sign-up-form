# Sign-up-form

# This project is a demonstration of my ability
# to create a simple sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
# I utilized a simple form structure to collect data with the purpose of created accounts for potential users
# In this structure I used some CSS for styling purposes to make the form look more user friendly as well as increasing readability 
# JavaScript was used to validate the form data and ensure that the user has entered the required information before
# submitting the form. This validation includes checking for empty fields, email format, and password length.
# The form also checks to ensure that the passwords being created matched the one thats input first if passwords don't match the form sends that user a prompt saying passwords are invalid.
